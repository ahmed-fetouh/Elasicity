        <p style="font-size:x-large;"><b style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Elasicity</b> is the property of a body by wich it experinces a change in size or shape</br>
             whenevera deforming force acts on the body. when the force is removed the body returns </br>
             to original and shape.most people are familiar with the stretching of a rubber band.</br>
             all materials.however.have this same elastic property.but in most materials it is not </br>
             so pronounced.

            <h2 style="color: blue;"><b>Definition</b></h2>
             <p style="font-size: x-large;">Elasticity is the measure of the sensitivity of one variable to another. A highly elastic</br>
             variable will respond more dramatically to changes in the variable it is dependent on.</br>
              The x-elasticity of y measures the fractional response of y to a fraction change in x,</br>
               which can be written as.

            <p style="font-size: x-large;">Companies that operate in fiercely competitive industries provide goods or services that</br>
             are elastic because these companies tend to be price-takers or those that must accept </br>
             prevailing prices. When the price of a good or service reaches the point of elasticity,</br> 
             sellers and buyers quickly adjust their demand for that good or service. The opposite of </br>
             elastic is inelastic. When a good or service is inelastic, sellers and buyers are not as likely</br>
              to adjust their demand for a good or service when the price changes.</br>
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large;">
             Elasticity is an important economic measure, particularly for the sellers of goods or services,</br>
             because it indicates how much of a good or service buyers consume when the price changes.</br>
              When a product is elastic, a change in price quickly results in a change in the quantity demanded.</br>
             When a good is inelastic, there is little change in the quantity of demand even with the change of</br>
             the good's price. The change that is observed for an elastic good is an increase in demand when </br>
             the price decreases and a decrease in demand when the price increases.

         <h2 style="color: blue;"><b>What are the types of modulus of elasticity?</b></h3></p>
         <p style="font-size: x-large;">There are three types of modulus of elasticity namely Youngâ€™s modulus,</br>
          shear modulus and bulk modulus.
